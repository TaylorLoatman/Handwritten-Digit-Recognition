# MNIST Digit Classifier with PyTorch

## Overview

This project involves building a neural network model to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a classic benchmark in machine learning and computer vision, consisting of grayscale images of digits (0-9). This project demonstrates the development of a digit classification model using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.

## Project Objectives

- **Implement a neural network model** to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- **Preprocess the dataset** and perform data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
- **Train the model** using PyTorch and evaluate its performance on test data.
- **Visualize the results** and display sample predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `matplotlib`: For visualizing images and training results.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `torch`: PyTorch library for building and training neural networks.
- `torchvision`: For dataset handling and image transformations.

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy torch torchvision
