    "You are tasked with creating a digit classifier that can accurately identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Your goal is to develop a neural network model using PyTorch to achieve this classification task. The dataset consists of images of handwritten digits (0-9), and you need to create a model that can classify them correctly. "

    "## Directions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Import Necessary Libraries  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Import essential libraries, including matplotlib, numpy, torch, and torchvision, to set up the environment for working with PyTorch and handling image data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define Data Transformations  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create a transformation pipeline (`transform`) to preprocess the images. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Transform the images into tensors and normalize pixel values to the range [-1, 1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load MNIST Dataset  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Load the MNIST dataset for both training and testing, applying the defined transformations. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Store the datasets in `trainset` and `testset`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create Data Loaders  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "   - Configure a batch size of 64 for both training and testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Enable shuffling for the training set to randomize the order of data. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "* Define a Function to Display Images  \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Define a function called `imshow` to display images. \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Unnormalize the image data (reverse the normalization process). \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Ensure that images are displayed correctly, especially if they have RGB channels. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "* Display Random Training Images  \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Extract a batch of random training images and their corresponding labels. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define a Custom Neural Network Model  \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Define a custom neural network model called `DigitClassifier` using PyTorch's `nn.Module`. \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Create two fully connected (linear) layers with ReLU activation. \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Specify the input size as 28x28 (MNIST image size) and the output size as 10 (for classifying digits 0-9). \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Implement the `forward` method to define how data flows through the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Define Loss Function and Optimization Algorithm  \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Define the loss function as the Cross-Entropy Loss using nn.CrossEntropyLoss(), suitable for classification tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Choose the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer as optim.SGD() with a learning rate and momentum to update model weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training Loop  \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Set the number of training epochs as 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Iterate through each epoch and initialize the running loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Loop through batches of training data and labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Zero the gradients to prevent accumulation using optimizer.zero_grad(). \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Perform a forward pass, compute the loss, and propagate gradients backward. \n",
    "\n",
    "   -  Update model weights using the optimizer.Accumulate the running loss for each batch. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluate the Model  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Initialize variables for counting correct predictions and total examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Disable gradient tracking to save memory and computation during evaluation using torch.no_grad().Iterate through the test data loader. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - For each batch, calculate predictions using the trained model and determine the predicted class.Keep track of the correct predictions and the total count. \n",
